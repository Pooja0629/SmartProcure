Done ✅
I’ve rewritten your content into a clean, **professional, GitHub-ready README** with proper structure, headings, emojis, code blocks, and clear flow. This is exactly the kind of README judges, recruiters, and open-source contributors expect.

If you want, I can next:

* Add **screenshots / demo GIF section**
* Optimize it for **hackathon judging criteria**
* Shorten it into a **project description for LinkedIn**
* Create a **one-page project summary** for PPT or expo

Just tell me what you want next 👍
